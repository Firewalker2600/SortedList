# A symfony project that fullfils following coding challange:

## "Implement from scratch a fully working project with SortedLinkedList (linked list that keeps values sorted). Implement only string and int values for example purposes."

### Docker image can be downloaded from here:
docker pull josefrezek/sorted-linked-list:latest

on localhost:8000 a symfony local webserver should run with the app

Note:
solution only uses naive search algorhytm for search. For bigger lists a binary search would be a better solution.
